  |   Rocket League is a high-powered hybrid of arcade-style soccer and     |
  |   vehicular mayhem with easy-to-understand controls and fluid,          |
  |   physics-driven competition. Rocket League includes casual and         |
  |   competitive Online Matches, a fully-featured offline Season Mode,     |
  |   special "Mutators" that let you change the rules entirely, hockey     |
  |   and basketball-inspired Extra Modes, and more than 500 trillion       |
  |   possible cosmetic customization combinations.                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Psyonix has announced a new Blueprint Update on Rocket League.        |
  |   Scheduled for December 4, it includes Crates and Keys replacing       |
  |   Blueprints and Credits, a new Item Shop, Rocket Pass 5, Season 12     |
  |   Competitive Rewards and Competitive Season 13, and quality of life    |
  |   improvements.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Here's a full rundown of the update:                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Rocket League isn't slowing down to end 2019. Blueprints, Rocket      |
  |   Pass 5, the new Item Shop, and more are all coming next month! Get    |
  |   ready for the Blueprint Update on December 4 (pending first-party     |
  |   certification) on all platforms.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Once the update goes live at 10 a.m. PST (5 p.m. UTC), Crates are     |
  |   out and Blueprints are in, and any Keys you have will convert to      |
  |   Credits. Here's everything you need to know to get ready for update   |
  |   day.                                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   SUPERSONIC FURY, REVENGE OF THE BATTLE-CARS,.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   AND CHAOS RUN BEING ADDED TO INVENTORIES.                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As soon as the update goes live, be sure to check your inventory.     |
  |   All items from Supersonic Fury, Revenge of the Battle-Cars, and       |
  |   Chaos Run DLC Packs will be added to all accounts on all platforms.   |
  |   Enjoy the extra cars and additional items!                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   BLUEPRINTS, INVENTORY CHANGES, AND ARCHIVING.                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Following the Blueprint Update, Blueprints will start to drop after   |
  |   select Online Matches. These new drops will show you a specific       |
  |   item that can then be built for Credits. You can build the item,      |
  |   trade it to a friend, or just keep it in your inventory.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Any unopened Crates you have in your inventory will be converted to   |
  |   unrevealed Blueprints of the same series, which you can reveal at     |
  |   no cost. You can find your revealed and unrevealed Blueprints in      |
  |   the new Blueprints tab in your inventory.                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Keys that you own will automatically convert to our new in-game       |
  |   currency called Credits. Credits can be used to build Blueprints,     |
  |   buy items from the Item Shop, or upgrade to Rocket Pass Premium.      |
  |   One Key will convert to 100 Credits.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Since this is a major conversion of items, Crates will stop           |
  |   dropping and all purchases in Rocket League will be disabled for 25   |
  |   hours leading up to the update beginning at 9 a.m. PST (5 p.m. UTC)   |
  |   on December 3. This includes the purchase of Keys and DLC Packs,      |
  |   player-to-player trades, trade-ins, and the ability to interact       |
  |   with any Crates you own. All Rocket League online playlists will      |
  |   still be up and running.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Trade-ins (trading five items for one item of a higher rarity) for    |
  |   items received from Crates will no longer be possible following the   |
  |   update. That means this is your last chance to trade in any           |
  |   duplicate Crate items before December 3. Free post-game drops will    |
  |   still be available for trade-in after the update.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With all new items hitting your inventories, you'll have a new        |
  |   place to put things you don't want to see. The update will bring      |
  |   the ability to archive your items. Archived items will be kept in     |
  |   the new Archive tab in your inventory.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   ITEM SHOP GRAND OPENING.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Item Shop is nearly open for business! Once the update goes       |
  |   live, you'll be able to check out this new storefront and browse      |
  |   in-game items that will rotate on a daily basis. Soon, you'll be      |
  |   able to see the exact price of an item and if it's Painted,           |
  |   Certified, or both! For more information on the Item Shop, check      |
  |   out our in-depth look.                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The arrival of the Item Shop means the Showroom is leaving. This      |
  |   includes all current Premium DLC Packs. These items will no longer    |
  |   be available for purchase as packs. Items from Premium DLC Packs      |
  |   may return for individual sale in the Item Shop at a later date.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   ROCKET PASS 5 INCOMING!                                               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Blueprint Update will start to draw the scene for Rocket Pass     |
  |   5, which will begin the same day as the update. Stay tuned for        |
  |   Rocket Pass 5's full reveal next week.                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   COMPETITIVE SEASON 13 BEGINS.                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Competitive Season 13 begins on the day of the update, which means    |
  |   Competitive Season 12 is coming to a close at 8 a.m. PST (2 p.m.      |
  |   UTC) on December 4.                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The arrival of Season 13 means it's time to distribute Season 12      |
  |   Rewards, which will be granted shortly after the update. You still    |
  |   have time to earn your Season 12 Decals. Just make sure you           |
  |   complete your placement matches in a Competitive Playlist and         |
  |   fulfill the appropriate Season Reward Level by December 4. Good       |
  |   luck out there!                                                       |
